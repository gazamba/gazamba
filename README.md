## Hi there, I'm Gabriel ðŸš€

My journey in technology began with a fascination for how things work behind the scenes. This curiosity evolved into a career where I thrive on delivering innovative, scalable, and reliable solutions. From crafting seamless integrations to building modern web applications, I enjoy the process of transforming ideas into reality through code.

With a strong foundation in data integration, API development, and enterprise platforms, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in designing and implementing custom solutions tailored to client needs. My ability to navigate complex challenges has enabled me to deliver meaningful results in collaborative, Agile-driven environments.

Iâ€™ve been diving deeper into web development, mastering tools like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Next.js, and Prisma. At the same time, Iâ€™m exploring the transformative potential of Blockchain and Web3 technologies. This intersection of cutting-edge tools and emerging trends excites me as I envision a future where decentralization and transparency redefine how we interact with technology.

What drives me is the opportunity to learn, innovate, and contribute to projects that make a difference. I thrive in collaborative teams that value curiosity and growth, and Iâ€™m eager to bring my blend of technical expertise and creative problem-solving to build the next generation of technology solutions.
